# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview - PyBer Analysis

Using Python and knowledge of Pandas, we'll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 

Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

Finally, we’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


## Resources
-  Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
-  Software:  Python 3.7.10,  Jupyter Notebook 6.4.0, Pandas 1.2.5, Matplotlib 3.3.4


# Challenge Summary

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. 
Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 


When looking at our riding sharing data we can see that Urban areas had the highest total rides with 1,625.  This was followed by Suburban total rides at 625 and Rural having 125 total rides.

The total drivers for Suburban, Rural and Rural are in line with the amount of rides for each area.  In Urban areas there are 2,405 drivers followed by Suburban with 490 and Rural with 78.

For all city types the total fares was $63,538.64.  Broken down by city type, Urban was the highest with $39,854.38 followed by Suburban ($19,356.33) and Rural ($4,327.93).

The average fair per ride and driver is highest in Rural areas with $34.62 per ride and $55.49 per driver.  This is followed by Suburban areas at $30.97 per ride and $39.50 per driver.  Urban areas had an average per ride of $24.53 and $16.57 average per driver
